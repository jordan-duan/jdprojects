## Projects
- [Stellar Age Estimation via Machine Learning](https://github.com/jordan-duan/stellar-age-estimation-via-ml)  
  Utilized Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Jupyter Notebook, and the Astroquery API to engineer and implement a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) stellar age estimation model, leveraging the GAIA Data Release 3 dataset of 1.47 billion stars.

- [UC Berkeley Course Enrollment Bot](https://github.com/jordan-duan/cal-course-enrollment-bot/)  
  Developed an automatic bot using Python, Selenium, and Google Cloud Console to facilitate enrollment in popular UC Berkeley courses.

- [FIFA Player Rating Predictor](https://github.com/jordan-duan/fifaratingpredictor)  
  Created a machine-learning model using Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, NumPy, and SciPy to predict FIFA23 player ratings.

- [Dungeon Explorer Game](https://github.com/jordan-duan/dungeonexplorer)  
  Designed and implemented a 2D game in Java using IntelliJ, StdDraw, Git, and GitHub, incorporating a binary space partitioning world generation algorithm for core game logic.

- [2048 Game]()  
  Designed and implemented a 2048 game in Java using IntelliJ, StdDraw, Git, and GitHub.
